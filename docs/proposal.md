## 1. Background  

### What is it about?  
The **Cost of Living Analysis & Prediction** project aims to analyze and predict living costs across U.S. states and counties using **machine learning regression models**. The dataset provides a detailed breakdown of household expenses, including housing, food, healthcare, childcare, transportation, taxes, and other necessities for different family structures and metro/non-metro areas.  

This project will deliver **data-driven insights** into regional affordability, identify the **main cost drivers**, and predict future cost trends to support **families, policymakers, and researchers**.  

---

### Why does it matter?  
- **Families:** Understand affordability differences before relocation or budgeting decisions.  
- **Policymakers:** Target high-cost regions for financial assistance or subsidies.  
- **Researchers:** Analyze cost-of-living disparities and economic inequality across regions.  

Cost of living is a **critical factor** influencing population migration, job selection, urban planning, and housing policies, making this project both **socially relevant** and **practically useful**.  

---

## 2. Research Questions  

1. Which U.S. states and regions have the **highest and lowest cost of living** for different family sizes?  
2. What **key factors** (e.g., housing, childcare, healthcare) drive the cost of living the most?  
3. Can we **predict total living costs** using machine learning models accurately?  
4. How do **metro vs. rural areas** compare in affordability patterns?

## 3. Dataset  

- **Source:** U.S. Cost of Living Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/us-cost-of-living-dataset-3171-counties)  
- **Data Size:** ~31,430 rows × 15 columns  
- **Geographic Coverage:** All 50 states + District of Columbia  
- **Family Types:** Single parent (1p0c) to large families (2p3c)  

Each row represents a unique combination of **county**, **family structure**, and **living cost details**.  

### Key Features:  
- `housing_cost`  
- `food_cost`  
- `transportation_cost`  
- `healthcare_cost`  
- `childcare_cost`  
- `taxes`  
- `isMetro` (1 = Metro, 0 = Rural)  
- `family_member_count`  

**Target Variable:**  
- `total_cost` (Total annual cost of living for a family)

## 4. Methodology  

### Phase 1: Data Preprocessing  
- Handle missing values and outliers  
- Feature engineering: family size, metro indicator  

### Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- State-wise affordability comparisons  
- Metro vs Rural cost trends  
- Cost component breakdown (housing, childcare, taxes)  

### Phase 3: Regression Modeling  
- **Linear Regression:** Baseline model for interpretability  
- **Random Forest Regressor:** Non-linear relationships & feature importance  
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** High predictive accuracy and robustness  

### Phase 4: Evaluation Metrics  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Measures prediction error magnitude  
- **R² (Explained Variance):** Measures how well models explain cost variability  

---

## 5. Expected Outcomes  

- **Predictive Models:** For accurate estimation of total cost of living across regions  
- **Key Insights:** Major cost drivers impacting affordability the most  
- **Visualization Dashboards:** State-wise and metro vs rural affordability patterns  
- **Policy Implications:** Recommendations for cost reduction in critical areas like housing and childcare  

---

## 6. Innovation & Uniqueness  

- **Granular Analysis:** Combining family size, metro status, and cost components for richer insights  
- **Policy-Relevant Findings:** Results useful for government planning and subsidies  
- **Scalable Approach:** Future extension possible for **time-series forecasting** of cost trends
